# FilmTrove
FilmTrove is an advanced movie database and recommendation management system tailored to deliver
personalized film discoveries and organized access to movie-related metadata. The platform integrates
core entities such as users, movies, cast, genres, ratings, languages, streaming availability, and watch
history to foster an engaging and personalized viewing experience.

The system features robust modules for user registration, authentication, movie metadata entry, watch
history logging, and review submission. It utilizes SQL-based queries in place of a traditional
recommendation engine to provide real-time, tailored recommendations based on user preferences and
viewing behavior. Admin users maintain control over database integrity through movie, user, and review
moderation panels.

By offering multilingual and multi-platform support, FilmTrove makes it easier for users to find content
across their preferred languages and streaming services. Backed by a relational schema normalized to
BCNF and developed using Visual Studio with C# and SQLPlus, FilmTrove ensures optimal data
integrity, performance, and scalability

FilmTrove was made by Siya Rath, Aditi Sinha and Asmita Guha for DBS Lab Project, 2025, in MIT, Manipal.
